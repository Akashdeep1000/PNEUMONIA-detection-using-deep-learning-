To get the best results please re-run the code from zero as the saved resnet model was too big to upload.


To Run the code please follow the following:

1. Download the dataset
2. Add the path according to were the dataset is located at
3. open the Pneumonia_detection.ipynb
4. Run the code for Resnet-18 from scratch(GPU usage is recommended)
5. Open the Pneumonia_detection_pretrained.ipynb
6. Run the code for Resnet-18 with pre-trained(GPU usage is recommended)
